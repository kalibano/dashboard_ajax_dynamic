User Registration and Authentication:

Create a registration form for users, storing their details in a database.
Implement Laravel's built-in authentication system for login functionality.


Dashboard:

Upon successful login, redirect the user to a dashboard page that displays a "Welcome [User Name]" message.

Dynamic Table with AJAX:

Create a feature on the dashboard where users can view a table of items (e.g., a list of tasks or products).
Implement an "Add New Item" button that opens a modal form. Use AJAX to add the new item to the database without refreshing the page.
Dynamically update the table with the newly added item after the AJAX request.


Validation with JavaScript:

Add client-side validation using JavaScript for the registration and modal forms.

- run php artisan migrate
- php artisan serve
